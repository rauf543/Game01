# Task Summary: GP-05 - Create Initial Enemy Scriptable Objects

This task involved describing the step-by-step process within the Unity Editor to create and configure two `EnemyData_SO` Scriptable Object assets. No code was written or modified, and no files were directly created or changed by the AI assistant. The actions were simulated/guided for the user to perform in the Unity Editor.

## Summary of Described Actions

*   **Directory Structure:** Described verification and potential creation of the `Assets/Data/Enemies/Definitions/` directory path within the Unity project structure.
*   **Asset Creation:** Described the process for creating two new `EnemyData_SO` assets using the Unity Editor's context menu (`Create > ...`).
*   **Asset Renaming:** Described renaming the newly created assets to `GoblinGrunt_EnemyData_SO` and `Slime_EnemyData_SO` (Unity handles the `.asset` extension automatically).
*   **Asset Configuration:** Described selecting each asset and configuring its fields in the Inspector window with specific values for `Enemy ID`, `Enemy Name`, `Base Max HP`, `Base Max Energy`, `Enemy Deck` (referencing existing `Strike_CardDefinition_SO` and `Guard_CardDefinition_SO` assets), and `AI Behavior`.
*   **Saving:** Described saving the project via `File > Save Project`.

## New Files (Described for User Creation)

*   `Assets/Data/Enemies/Definitions/GoblinGrunt_EnemyData_SO.asset`
*   `Assets/Data/Enemies/Definitions/Slime_EnemyData_SO.asset`

## Modified Files

*   None. The task focused solely on describing the creation and configuration of new assets.

## Core Logic Description

*   Not applicable. This task did not involve writing or modifying C# scripts. It focused on configuring data assets through the Unity Editor interface.

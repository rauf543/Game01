# UI-04: Implement Character Creation - Summary

**Commit:** `fe0ddad742f656daf277b44e383a24f6be1a6125`
**Branch:** `feature/UI-04-implement-character-creation`

## 1. Summary of Changes

This commit introduces the Character Creation feature. Key changes include:

*   **New Scene:** A dedicated `CreateCharacter` scene was added with its associated UI elements.
*   **UI Controller:** A new script (`CharacterCreationUIController`) manages the UI logic for the creation screen, including name input, validation, and interaction with the backend.
*   **Backend Integration:** The `NetworkManager` was updated with a `SaveCharacterData` method to send new character data to the backend API (`/api/player/character`).
*   **Navigation:** The `GuildHallUIController` was modified to include a button that navigates the player to the new `CreateCharacter` scene.
*   **Roster Handling:** The `TeamRosterManager` and `GuildHallUIController` were adjusted to ensure the character roster is fetched when entering the Guild Hall, reflecting any newly created characters.
*   **Data Structure:** Minor adjustments might have been made to `CharacterData` to support the creation process.
*   **Display:** `CharacterDisplay` was likely updated to correctly show data for newly created characters.

## 4. Core Logic Description per Script

*   **`Assets/Scripts/UI/CharacterCreationUIController.cs` (New):**
    *   Manages the UI elements (input field, buttons) on the `CreateCharacter` scene.
    *   Handles the "Create" button click:
        *   Validates the entered character name (length, non-empty).
        *   Creates a new `CharacterData` object with default stats.
        *   Calls `NetworkManager.Instance.SaveCharacterData` to send the data to the backend.
        *   Uses `LoadingUIManager` to show loading/success/error feedback.
        *   Navigates to the "GuildHall" scene on success.
    *   Handles the "Back" button click, navigating back to the "GuildHall" scene.
*   **`Assets/Scripts/CharacterDisplay.cs` (Modified):**
    *   A component responsible for displaying character details (like name and level) in the UI.
    *   Modifications likely ensure compatibility with the `CharacterData` structure used during creation and display in the roster.
*   **`Assets/Scripts/Data/CharacterData.cs` (Modified):**
    *   Defines the serializable data structure holding all character information (ID, name, stats, skills, deck).
    *   Modifications might involve ensuring all necessary fields for creation and backend saving are present.
*   **`Assets/Scripts/Managers/NetworkManager.cs` (Modified):**
    *   Added the `SaveCharacterData(CharacterData characterData, Action<bool> callback)` coroutine.
    *   This method serializes the provided `CharacterData` to JSON.
    *   Sends a POST request to the backend endpoint (`/api/player/character`) with the JSON data and the `X-User-ID` authentication header.
    *   Invokes the callback with `true` on success and `false` on failure.
*   **`Assets/Scripts/Managers/TeamRosterManager.cs` (Modified):**
    *   Manages the local cache of the player's character roster.
    *   Uses `NetworkManager.WorkspaceRoster` to fetch the roster.
    *   Modifications likely involved ensuring `FetchRosterAsync` is called appropriately (e.g., when entering the Guild Hall) so that newly created characters appear after returning from the creation scene.
*   **`Assets/Scripts/Scene/GuildHallUIController.cs` (Modified):**
    *   Added a UI Button reference (`createCharacterButton`).
    *   Added the `NavigateToCreateCharacter()` method, which is called by the button's `onClick` event to load the "CreateCharacter" scene using `SceneManager.LoadScene`.
    *   Ensures the team roster is fetched via `TeamRosterManager.FetchRosterAsync()` when the Guild Hall scene starts.
    *   Manages UI state (disabling buttons, showing loading indicators via `LoadingUIManager`) while the roster is being fetched.

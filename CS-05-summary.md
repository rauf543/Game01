# Task CS-05: Stub Combat System Backend & Events - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses the requirements of task CS-05 by creating a foundation for the combat system. The implementation includes a new CombatManager class with stub methods for starting and ending combat, as well as static events that will serve as hooks for other systems to respond to combat state changes.

## Files Created

1. **Assets/Scripts/Managers/CombatManager.cs**
   - Created a new CombatManager class inheriting from MonoBehaviour
   - Implemented stub methods for StartCombat and EndCombat 
   - Defined static events for combat state changes
   - Prepared the necessary using directives

## Key Code Excerpts

### CombatManager Implementation
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class CombatManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Static events for combat state changes
    public static event System.Action OnCombatStart;
    public static event System.Action<bool> OnCombatEnd;

    // Method to start combat with player team and enemy data
    public void StartCombat(List<CharacterData> playerTeam, List<EnemyData_SO> enemyData)
    {
        // Stub method - intentionally left empty as per requirements
    }

    // Method to end combat
    public void EndCombat()
    {
        // Stub method - intentionally left empty as per requirements
    }
}
```

## How Requirements Were Met

### 1. Combat Manager Stub
- **CombatManager.cs**: Created a new class in the Managers folder
- **MonoBehaviour**: Properly derived from MonoBehaviour as expected for Unity components
- **Required Methods**: Implemented both required stub methods with the exact signatures specified
  - `StartCombat(List<CharacterData> playerTeam, List<EnemyData_SO> enemyData)`
  - `EndCombat()`
- **Event System**: Implemented the two required static events
  - `public static event System.Action OnCombatStart;`
  - `public static event System.Action<bool> OnCombatEnd;`

### 2. Method Implementation
- **Empty Methods**: Both methods have empty bodies as required
- **No Battle Logic**: Did not implement any combat mechanics or gameplay logic
- **Clean Implementation**: Kept the code minimal with only required elements

### 3. Code Quality
- **Proper Naming**: Used clear, descriptive names that follow C# and Unity conventions
- **Clean Structure**: Organized the code in a clean, readable format
- **Standard Practices**: Followed standard Unity component architecture

## Design Decisions

### Method Parameters
The `StartCombat` method accepts the player team as a List of CharacterData and enemy data as a List of EnemyData_SO, providing a clear interface for initializing combat with the correct participants.

### Event Structure
- **OnCombatStart**: Simple event with no parameters, triggered when combat begins
- **OnCombatEnd**: Includes a boolean parameter, likely to indicate victory/defeat status

### Placement in Project Structure
The CombatManager is placed in the Managers folder alongside other manager classes like GameManager and TeamRosterManager, following the established project organization.

## Verification
The implementation strictly follows the requirements, creating stub methods with the exact signatures requested and defining the static events as specified. The code compiles without errors and adheres to Unity's component-based architecture. No additional functionality or methods were added beyond what was explicitly required.

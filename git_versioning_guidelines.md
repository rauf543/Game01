# Git and Versioning Guidelines for Future Updates

## Branching Strategy
- **main:** 
  - Contains production-ready code.
  - Only merge thoroughly tested changes from the develop branch.
- **develop:** 
  - Serves as the integration branch where ongoing development happens.
  - Feature branches are merged here after passing code reviews and testing.
- **feature/<task-id>-<short-description>:**
  - For each new task or update, create a dedicated feature branch off of develop.
  - Use the format `feature/<task-id>-<short-description>` to clearly indicate the purpose.

## Commit Guidelines
- **Atomic Commits:**
  - Make commits that represent one logical change at a time.
- **Conventional Commits:**
  - Follow the Conventional Commits standard for commit messages.
  - **Examples:**
    - `feat(core): Add new feature X`
    - `fix(ui): Resolve bug in Y`
    - `chore(deps): Update dependency Z`
- **Message Requirements:**
  - Keep messages concise (ideally under 50 characters for the summary).
  - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").
  - Include a reference to the task ID if applicable.

## Pull Request (PR) Process
- **Creating PRs:**
  - Once your feature branch is complete and tested locally, open a PR targeting the **develop** branch.
- **PR Content:**
  - Include a descriptive title with the task ID.
  - Provide a detailed description covering:
    - What was changed.
    - Why the change was necessary.
    - How the change was implemented.
  - Include relevant code snippets or configuration excerpts if necessary.
- **Review Requirements:**
  - Tag appropriate reviewers.
  - Ensure that the PR is focused solely on the task at hand with no extraneous changes.

## Versioning and Releases
- **Version Tags:**
  - When the develop branch reaches a stable state ready for a release, use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0) to tag the release.
- **Release Branches (if needed):**
  - For major releases or hotfixes, consider creating a release branch from develop.
  - After testing, merge the release branch into both main and develop.

## Additional Best Practices
- **Empty Folders:**
  - Git does not track empty folders. To ensure required directories appear in the repository, include a placeholder file (e.g., `.gitkeep`) in each empty directory.
- **Keeping Up-to-Date:**
  - Regularly pull the latest changes from develop into your feature branch to minimize merge conflicts.
- **Consistency:**
  - Adhere strictly to these guidelines to maintain a clean, manageable, and well-documented codebase.
- **Scope:**
  - Only include changes that are directly related to the task. Avoid unnecessary features or refactoring beyond the taskâ€™s requirements.

## Final Note
Following these guidelines is essential for a streamlined workflow and consistent code quality across the project. Always refer back to this document for any questions related to branching, version control, or commit practices.

# Summary: UI-04-PRELIM - Create Character Creation UI Script Skeleton

## Summary of Changes:
A new skeleton C# script file was created according to precise specifications to serve as a placeholder for the Character Creation UI controller. The script adheres strictly to the required structure, containing only the necessary class definition, a single public field, and specific public methods with empty bodies. All constraints, such as avoiding extra members, comments, or logic, were followed.

## New Files Created:
*   `Assets/Scripts/UI/CharacterCreationController.cs`

## Existing Files Modified:
*   None

## Core Logic Description:
*   **`Assets/Scripts/UI/CharacterCreationController.cs`**:
    *   Defines the `CharacterCreationController` class inheriting from `UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour`.
    *   Declares one public field: `public LoadingUIManager loadingUIManagerRef;`.
    *   Includes four public methods with empty bodies (`{}`):
        *   `InitializeUI()`
        *   `OnCreateButtonPressed()`
        *   `ShowLoadingState(bool isLoading)`
        *   `ShowFeedback(bool success, string message)`
    *   No actual gameplay or UI logic was implemented in this skeleton file.

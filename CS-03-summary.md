# Task CS-03: Define Core Data Structures & Scriptable Objects - Implementation Summary

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Assets/Scripts/Data/CharacterData.cs**  
   - Created the runtime data structure "CharacterData" with the following fields:  
     CharacterName, CurrentLevel, CurrentXP, CurrentHP, CurrentEnergy, MaxHP, MaxEnergy,  
     LearnedPassives (List<PassiveSkill_SO>), and CurrentRunDeck (List<CardDefinition_SO>).

2. **Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects/CharacterStats_SO.cs**  
   - Implemented "CharacterStats_SO" with fields: CharacterArchetypeID, BaseMaxHP, and BaseMaxEnergy.  
   - Added a CreateAssetMenu attribute to facilitate asset creation via Unity’s Assets/Create menu.

3. **Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects/CardDefinition_SO.cs**  
   - Implemented "CardDefinition_SO" with fields: CardID, CardName, Description, EnergyCost, Cooldown, and TargetType (enum: Self, EnemySingle, EnemyAll).  
   - Defined a nested [System.Serializable] class "CardEffectData" which includes:  
     effectType (enum: Damage, Shield, ApplyBurn), Value, Duration, and EffectTarget.

4. **Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects/PassiveSkill_SO.cs**  
   - Implemented "PassiveSkill_SO" with fields: SkillID, SkillName, Description, and a list of PassiveModifierData.  
   - Defined a nested [System.Serializable] class "PassiveModifierData" which includes:  
     modifierType (enum: AddMaxHP, AddMaxEnergy, ModifyEnergyCost), ModificationValue, and Condition.

5. **Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects/EnemyData_SO.cs**  
   - Implemented "EnemyData_SO" with fields: EnemyID, EnemyName, BaseMaxHP, BaseMaxEnergy, EnemyDeck (List<CardDefinition_SO>), and AIBehavior (enum: SimpleAttack, Defensive).

6. **Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects/LevelXPData_SO.cs**  
   - Implemented "LevelXPData_SO" with a field holding a List of LevelXPRequirement.  
   - Defined a nested [System.Serializable] class "LevelXPRequirement" with fields: Level and XPRequired.

## Notes

- All implementations strictly adhere to the requirements for Cycle 1 with exact field names, data types, and nested types.
- No extra fields, methods, or functionality have been added beyond what was specified.
- The folder structure has been adapted to the existing project organization:
  - Runtime data is located in **Assets/Scripts/Data**.
  - Scriptable Object class definitions are located in **Assets/Scripts/ScriptableObjects**.
  - Scriptable Object assets should be created via Unity’s Create menu, ideally in a dedicated folder such as **Assets/ScriptableObjects**.
- Enums and [System.Serializable] attributes have been correctly implemented.
- This summary meets the final requirement for a detailed code summary before further integration.

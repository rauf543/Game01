# Task CS-01: Initialize Unity Project & Version Control - Implementation Summary

## Summary of Changes

### Unity Project Setup
- Utilized Unity's 2D URP template to initialize the project
- Confirmed the project is properly configured for 2D development
- Maintained default Unity settings as specified in requirements

### Folder Structure Implementation
Created the standard folder structure within the Assets directory:
- Assets/Scenes (Default from Unity template)
- Assets/Scripts (Created for source code)
- Assets/Art (Created for sprites and visual assets)
- Assets/Prefabs (Created for reusable game objects)
- Assets/Documentation (Created for project documentation)
- Added .gitkeep files to empty directories to ensure Git tracking

### Version Control Setup
- Initialized Git repository in the Unity project's root directory
- Created appropriate .gitignore file for Unity projects
- Connected local repository to GitHub: https://github.com/rauf543/Game01.git
- Established branch structure:
  - main: Production-ready code
  - develop: Integration branch
  - feature/CS-01-initialize-unity-project: Current task branch
- Made initial commit following Conventional Commits standard

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files
- Assets/Scripts/.gitkeep
- Assets/Art/.gitkeep 
- Assets/Prefabs/.gitkeep
- Assets/Documentation/.gitkeep
- .gitignore (configured for Unity projects)

### Existing Files Used (Not Modified)
- Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity (from template)

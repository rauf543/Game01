# UI-01-Refactor – Handle Async Loading Summary

## Overview

This task focused on implementing asynchronous loading indicators, disabling UI elements during network operations, and handling error states in the Unity UI, specifically for:
1. Login screen (UI-AUTH-01)
2. Guild Hall roster loading (UI-03-Refactor)

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. Assets/Scripts/UI/LoadingUIManager.cs (Created)
- Created a centralized manager to handle loading indicators and error messages across UI screens
- Implemented methods for showing/hiding loading states and error messages
- Keeps loading/error UI management consistent across the application

### 2. Assets/Scripts/Scene/MainMenuUIController.cs (Modified)
- Added LoadingUIManager reference and integration
- Implemented loading indicator display during NetworkManager.Login() calls
- Added button disabling while logging in to prevent multiple clicks
- Added error message display on failed login attempts
- Implemented Start button enable/disable logic based on login success
- **(Refactor)** Removed direct `NetworkManager` reference; now uses `NetworkManager.Instance`.

### 3. Assets/Scripts/Managers/TeamRosterManager.cs (Modified)
- Added loading state tracking for workspace roster async operations
- Implemented events to notify subscribers about loading start/finish
- Added error handling for failed roster fetches
- Consistent pattern for tracking async operation states
- **(Refactor)** Updated `Awake` to use `NetworkManager.Instance`.
- **(Fix)** Commented out automatic `FetchRosterAsync()` call in `Start()` to prevent premature, unauthenticated requests.

### 4. Assets/Scripts/Scene/GuildHallUIController.cs (Modified)
- Added LoadingUIManager integration for roster loading
- Subscribed to TeamRosterManager loading events
- Implemented button disabling during roster loading
- Added error message display on roster fetch failures
- Re-enabled UI elements appropriately after success/failure
- **(Fix)** Added explicit call to `teamRosterManager.FetchRosterAsync()` in `Start()` to trigger roster loading only when entering the scene.

### 5. Assets/Scripts/UI/README.md (Created)
- Provided documentation for setting up the UI elements
- Included steps for creating loading/error panels
- Detailed instructions for GameObject references and hierarchy

### 6. Backend Changes (Modified)
- Added URL-encoded form data parsing to handle Unity's form submissions
- Fixed API route structure to ensure correct URL paths
- Added enhanced debugging to help troubleshoot authentication issues
- **(Fix)** Corrected login response JSON to include `UserID` (uppercase D) instead of `userId`.

### 7. Assets/Scripts/Managers/NetworkManager.cs (Modified)
- **(Refactor)** Implemented Singleton pattern (`Instance`, `Awake`, `DontDestroyOnLoad`).
- **(Refactor)** Updated API call methods (`Login`, `WorkspaceRoster`, `SaveCharacterData`) to use `baseUrl` from `BackendConfig`.
- **(Fix)** Corrected `WorkspaceRoster` endpoint path from `/workspace_roster` to `/roster`.
- **(Fix)** Added `authenticatedUserId` field to store user ID after login.
- **(Fix)** Updated `Login` method to store the `UserID` in `authenticatedUserId`.
- **(Fix)** Updated `WorkspaceRoster` method to add `X-User-ID` header using `authenticatedUserId`.
- **(Fix)** Corrected `LoginResponse` class field from `userId` to `UserID` to match backend JSON key case for proper parsing.
- **(Debug)** Added temporary debug logs to trace authentication flow (can be removed later).

### 8. Assets/Scripts/Managers/GameManager.cs (Modified)
- **(Refactor)** Removed direct `NetworkManager` and `BackendConfig` references.
- **(Refactor)** Updated `InitializeComponents` to load `NetworkManager` prefab from `Resources/Prefabs/NetworkManager` using `Resources.Load()` if `NetworkManager.Instance` is null.

### 9. Unity Project Structure (User Action)
- **(Refactor)** Created `Assets/Resources/Prefabs/` folder structure.
- **(Refactor)** Moved configured `NetworkManager` prefab to `Assets/Resources/Prefabs/NetworkManager.prefab`.

## Implementation Details

### Loading Indicator Implementation
- Simple text-based "Loading..." and rotating spinner implemented
- Loading panels are toggled using GameObject activation (not just interactability)
- Centralized through LoadingUIManager for consistent UX across screens

### UI Interaction Locking
- Critical buttons (Login, Guild Hall navigation) are disabled during async operations
- Used Button.interactable property (not GameObject activation) for interactive elements
- Clear visual feedback to users that actions are in progress

### Error Handling
- Informative error messages replace loading indicators on failure
- Appropriate UI elements are re-enabled for retry attempts
- Users can clearly see when an operation fails and why

### Deployment Notes
- UI elements must be properly assigned in the Inspector
- Make sure GameObjects for panels start as inactive, but buttons start as active
- For buttons, use interactable=false initially, not SetActive(false)
- **(Refactor)** Ensure `NetworkManager.prefab` exists at `Assets/Resources/Prefabs/NetworkManager.prefab` and has `BackendConfig.asset` assigned.
- **(Refactor)** Ensure `GameInitializer` script in the initial scene has necessary prefab references assigned (e.g., `GameManager`, `SceneLoader`) if not using `Resources.Load` for them.

## Testing Results
- Login sequence correctly shows loading state, disables login button
- Success properly enables Start button, error shows message
- Guild Hall roster loading shows spinner, disables relevant buttons
- All error states display appropriate messages
- **(Fix)** Authentication persists correctly between scenes.
- **(Fix)** Roster is fetched only after login and upon entering Guild Hall.

## Issues Resolved
- Fixed API path issues with backend connectivity
- Corrected form data parsing on backend
- Resolved confusion between GameObject activation vs Button interactability
- **(Refactor/Fix)** Correctly implemented persistent `NetworkManager` singleton using `Resources.Load`.
- **(Fix)** Corrected roster API endpoint path mismatch between client and server.
- **(Fix)** Implemented `X-User-ID` header for authenticated requests.
- **(Fix)** Resolved premature roster fetch attempt before authentication.
- **(Fix)** Corrected JSON parsing issue for `UserID` due to case mismatch.

## Conclusion
All requirements from the task specification have been met. The implementation provides a consistent, user-friendly experience during asynchronous operations while preventing unwanted user interactions during loading states. The refactored NetworkManager provides a robust, persistent singleton pattern for handling network requests across scenes.

Okay, I will append the summary of the debugging and final fixes to the existing `UI-01-Refactor-summary.md`.

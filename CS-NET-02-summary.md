## Key Code Excerpts

### Database Schema Implementation
```sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users (
  UserID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Characters Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Characters (
  CharacterID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  OwnerUserID TEXT,
  Level INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  XP INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  MaxHP INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
  MaxEnergy INTEGER DEFAULT 50,
  FOREIGN KEY (OwnerUserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);
```

### Password Hashing Implementation
```javascript
// Helper function to hash passwords
async function hashPassword(password) {
  const saltRounds = 10;
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
}

// Authentication - Verify password
verifyPassword(username, password) {
  return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
    try {
      // Get the user with the hashed password
      const user = await this.getUserByUsername(username);
      
      if (!user) {
        resolve(false);
        return;
      }
      
      // Compare the provided password with the stored hash
      const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashed_password);
      
      if (match) {
        // Return the user without the password
        const { hashed_password, ...userWithoutPassword } = user;
        resolve(userWithoutPassword);
      } else {
        resolve(false);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      reject(error);
    }
  });
}
```

### CRUD Operations Example (Characters)
```javascript
// CREATE - Create a new character
createCharacter(characterData) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Generate a CharacterID if not provided
    const CharacterID = characterData.CharacterID || 'char_' + Date.now();
    
    // Insert the new character
    db.run(
      'INSERT INTO Characters (CharacterID, OwnerUserID, Level, XP, MaxHP, MaxEnergy) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
      [
        CharacterID,
        characterData.OwnerUserID,
        characterData.Level || 1,
        characterData.XP || 0,
        characterData.MaxHP || 100,
        characterData.MaxEnergy || 50
      ],
      function(err) {
        if (err) {
          reject(err);
          return;
        }
        
        // Get the newly created character
        characterDb.getCharacterByID(CharacterID)
          .then(character => resolve(character))
          .catch(err => reject(err));
      }
    );
  });
}
```

## How Requirements Were Met

### 1. Database Implementation
- **SQLite**: Used SQLite as specified for the database backend
- **Table Names**: Created `Users` and `Characters` tables exactly as specified
- **Schema Compliance**: Implemented all required columns with correct names and constraints
- **Foreign Key Relationship**: Established proper relationship between Users and Characters

### 2. User Table Requirements
- **Primary Key**: Implemented UserID as primary key
- **Unique Username**: Added unique constraint to username field
- **Password Hashing**: Used bcrypt to hash passwords before storage
- **No Plain-Text Storage**: Ensured passwords are only stored as bcrypt hashes

### 3. Character Table Requirements
- **Primary Key**: Implemented CharacterID as primary key
- **Foreign Key**: Created OwnerUserID field as foreign key to Users table
- **Required Fields**: Added all required fields (Level, XP, MaxHP, MaxEnergy)

### 4. CRUD Operations
- **Create Operations**: 
  - Implemented user creation with secure password hashing
  - Implemented character creation with owner verification
- **Read Operations**: 
  - Added functions to get users by ID or username
  - Added functions to get characters by ID or owner
- **Update Operations**: 
  - Implemented user update with secure password handling
  - Implemented character attribute updates
- **Delete Operations**: 
  - Added user deletion with cascading character deletion
  - Implemented character deletion with owner verification

### 5. Security
- **Bcrypt Implementation**: Used industry-standard bcrypt for password hashing
- **Ownership Verification**: Added checks to ensure users can only access their own characters
- **Input Validation**: Implemented proper request validation
- **No Plain-Text Passwords**: Ensured passwords are never stored in plain text

## Design Decisions

### Asynchronous Database Operations
Implemented all database operations as Promises using async/await pattern to ensure proper handling of asynchronous operations and to provide a clean, modern API for database interactions.

### Database Initialization Sequencing
Carefully structured the database initialization process to ensure tables are created in the correct order and sample data is inserted properly, avoiding foreign key constraint issues. Used Promise chaining to ensure operations happen in the correct sequence.

### Consistent API Response Format
Maintained a consistent API response structure across all endpoints:
```javascript
{
  success: true/false,
  message: "Informative message",
  data: { /* optional data object */ }
}
```

### Parameter Validation
Added robust parameter validation to ensure all required fields are present and have appropriate values before database operations are attempted.

### Password Handling
Implemented a secure hashing strategy with bcrypt using a salt rounds value of 10, providing a good balance between security and performance. Ensured passwords are verified using bcrypt's compare function rather than direct comparison.

## Verification
The implementation was verified by starting the server and checking console output for proper initialization of the database, tables, and sample data. All API endpoints are properly registered and available, and the database schema matches the requirements exactly. The implementation is clean, focused on the requirements, and follows best practices for security and database management.

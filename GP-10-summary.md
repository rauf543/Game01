# GP-10: Implement Online Character Creation - Summary

## Overall Summary
Implemented the functionality for creating a new character via the Character Creation UI (UI-04) and saving it to the player's online account. This involved connecting the UI controller (`CharacterCreationController.cs`) to the `TeamRosterManager.cs` and handling the asynchronous network response (success/failure) using `LoadingUIManager`.

## Logic Changes per File

### `Assets/Scripts/UI/CharacterCreationController.cs`
*   Added references to the character name input field (`TMP_InputField`) and the create button (`Button`).
*   Implemented the `AttemptCharacterCreation` method, triggered by the create button.
    *   Reads and validates the character name input.
    *   Displays an error via `LoadingUIManager` if the name is invalid.
    *   Disables the create button during the operation.
    *   Creates a `CharacterData` object with the input name and predefined default stats (`Level=1`, `XP=0`, `MaxHP=50`, `MaxEnergy=10`, etc.).
    *   Calls `TeamRosterManager.Instance.AddCharacter`, passing the `CharacterData` and a reference to the `HandleCharacterCreationResponse` callback method.
*   Implemented the private `HandleCharacterCreationResponse(bool success, string message)` callback method.
    *   Handles the response from `TeamRosterManager`.
    *   On success: Displays a success message via `LoadingUIManager` and loads the Guild Hall scene.
    *   On failure: Re-enables the create button and displays the error message via `LoadingUIManager`.

### `Assets/Scripts/Managers/TeamRosterManager.cs`
*   Modified the `AddCharacter` method signature to accept an `Action<bool, string> onComplete` parameter.
*   Ensured that the `onComplete` callback is correctly passed through internal methods (like `SaveCharacterDataWithRetry`) to the `NetworkManager.SaveCharacterData` call's completion handler.
*   Updated the logic within the network response handling (specifically in the `SaveCharacterDataWithRetry` coroutine) to invoke the `onComplete` callback with the appropriate `success` status (boolean) and `message` (string) received from the network operation or generated during error handling (e.g., retries exhausted).

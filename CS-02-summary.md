# Task CS-02: Implement Scene Management & Basic GameManager - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation fulfills the requirements of task CS-02 by adding basic scene management and a persistent GameManager to the Unity project. The implementation includes synchronous scene loading capabilities and a GameManager that persists across scene transitions while maintaining essential game state.

## Files Created

1. **Assets/Scripts/Scene/SceneLoader.cs**
   - Handles synchronous scene transitions using `SceneManager.LoadScene()`
   - Provides dedicated methods for loading each core scene

2. **Assets/Scripts/Managers/GameManager.cs**
   - Implemented as a Singleton pattern
   - Persists across scene loads using `DontDestroyOnLoad()`
   - Maintains a reference to the TeamRosterManager
   - Tracks mission state with a simple boolean flag

3. **Assets/Scripts/Managers/TeamRosterManager.cs**
   - Simple placeholder for the team roster management system
   - Will be properly implemented in a future task

4. **Assets/Scripts/Managers/GameInitializer.cs**
   - Helper class to ensure proper initialization of managers in each scene
   - Creates GameManager and SceneLoader instances if they don't exist

5. **Assets/Scripts/Demo/SceneTransitionDemo.cs**
   - Demo script for testing scene transitions
   - Connects UI buttons to the SceneLoader functionality
   - Demonstrates state persistence across scene loads

## Key Code Excerpts

### SceneLoader Implementation
```csharp
public class SceneLoader : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Scene names as constants to avoid string errors
    public const string MAIN_MENU_SCENE = "MainMenu";
    public const string GUILD_HALL_SCENE = "GuildHall";
    public const string MISSION_MAP_SCENE = "MissionMap";
    public const string COMBAT_SCENE = "Combat";

    /// <summary>
    /// Loads the Main Menu scene.
    /// </summary>
    public void LoadMainMenu()
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(MAIN_MENU_SCENE);
    }

    // Similar methods for other scenes...

    /// <summary>
    /// Generic method to load any scene by its name.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="sceneName">The name of the scene to load</param>
    public void LoadScene(string sceneName)
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneName);
    }
}
```

### GameManager Singleton Implementation
```csharp
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Singleton instance
    private static GameManager _instance;
    
    public static GameManager Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                Debug.LogError("GameManager instance not found. Ensure it exists in the scene.");
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }

    // Reference to the TeamRosterManager
    [SerializeField] private TeamRosterManager teamRosterManager;
    public TeamRosterManager TeamRoster => teamRosterManager;

    // Flag to track if player is currently in a mission
    private bool _isInMission = false;
    public bool IsInMission 
    { 
        get => _isInMission; 
        set => _isInMission = value; 
    }

    private void Awake()
    {
        // Ensure singleton pattern - only one GameManager exists
        if (_instance == null)
        {
            _instance = this;
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
            InitializeComponents();
        }
        else
        {
            // Destroy duplicate instances
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
}
```

## How Requirements Were Met

### 1. Scene Transitions
- **Synchronous Loading**: Used `SceneManager.LoadScene()` for all scene transitions, avoiding any asynchronous loading methods
- **SceneLoader Script**: Created a dedicated script with specific functions to load each scene by name
- **No Extra Features**: Did not implement loading screens, transition effects, or other unnecessary features

### 2. GameManager Implementation
- **Singleton Pattern**: Implemented the GameManager as a proper Singleton with a static Instance property
- **State Persistence**: Used `DontDestroyOnLoad()` to ensure the GameManager persists across scene loads
- **Essential Data Storage**: 
  - Maintains a reference to TeamRosterManager
  - Includes a simple boolean flag (isInMission) to track mission state
- **Scope Limitation**: 
  - Does not store detailed runtime data like character HP, inventory items, etc.
  - Focused only on high-level state management

### 3. Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: All scripts are well-organized, properly commented, and follow consistent naming conventions
- **Minimal Implementation**: Added only what was necessary to fulfill requirements without extraneous features
- **Maintainability**: Code is structured to be easily maintained and extended in future tasks

## Design Decisions

### TeamRosterManager Placeholder
Since CS-02 refers to the TeamRosterManager which isn't implemented yet, I created a simple placeholder class that will be replaced with a proper implementation in a future task. This allows the GameManager to reference it without errors.

### Updated API Calls
Replaced deprecated `FindObjectOfType<T>()` calls with the recommended `FindFirstObjectByType<T>()` method in GameManager.cs and SceneTransitionDemo.cs to resolve CS0618 obsolescence warnings. This ensures the code uses the current Unity API and avoids potential performance issues with the deprecated methods.

### GameInitializer Helper
Added a GameInitializer script that helps ensure the proper initialization of managers in each scene. This simplifies the setup process and reduces the chance of errors or missing components.

### Scene Transition Demo
Included a demo script to facilitate testing the scene transitions and GameManager persistence. This script connects UI elements to the SceneLoader functionality and provides a visual way to verify that the implementation works as expected.

## Verification
The implemented scene management system allows reliable switching between the four core scenes (MainMenu, GuildHall, MissionMap, and Combat) using synchronous loading. The GameManager persists across scene loads and correctly maintains the team roster reference and mission state flag. The implementation is clean, concise, and adheres strictly to the task requirements without any extra features or overengineering.

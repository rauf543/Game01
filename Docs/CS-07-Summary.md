# Summary: CS-07 Implement Core Combat Actions Backend

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the backend logic for core combat actions (Damage, Shield, Status Effects) as part of task CS-07.

## 1. New Files Created

*   `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Enums/StatusEffectType.cs`: Defines the `StatusEffectType` enum (Burn, Shielded, AttackUp, DefenseDown).
*   `Assets/Scripts/Combat/Data/ActiveStatusEffect.cs`: Defines the `ActiveStatusEffect` class to store runtime status effect data (Type, Duration, Stacks).
*   `Assets/Scripts/Combat/CharacterCombat.cs`: MonoBehaviour script attached to character prefabs. Manages runtime combat state (CurrentHP, MaxHP, CurrentShield, ActiveEffects) and provides methods to modify this state (`Initialize`, `TakeDamage`, `ReceiveShield`, `ReceiveStatusEffect`, `TickStatusEffects`).
*   `Assets/Scripts/Combat/CombatActions.cs`: Static utility class providing centralized methods (`DealDamage`, `ApplyShield`, `ApplyStatusEffect`) to apply combat effects to target GameObjects by safely interacting with their `CharacterCombat` component.

## 2. Existing Files Modified

*   `Assets/Scripts/Managers/CombatManager.cs`:
    *   Added necessary `using` statements for new combat namespaces.
    *   Added lists (`playerCharacters`, `enemyCharacters`) to hold references to active `CharacterCombat` components.
    *   Modified `StartCombat` to include placeholder logic for instantiating characters, retrieving/adding their `CharacterCombat` components, and calling `Initialize` to set up their combat state.
    *   Added a placeholder method `ResolveCombatAction` demonstrating how external systems (like card resolution) would call the static methods in `CombatActions` (e.g., `CombatActions.DealDamage`).
    *   Added a placeholder method `ProcessTurnEnd` demonstrating how the turn sequence manager would iterate through active characters and call `character.TickStatusEffects()` to process status effects.
    *   Modified `EndCombat` to include placeholder cleanup of instantiated character GameObjects.
*   `Assets/Prefabs/Character_Prefab.prefab`:
    *   **Modified manually by the user (as instructed)** to add the `CharacterCombat` script as a component.

## 3. Confirmation

*   All instructions and restrictions detailed in the provided `task_instructions.md` document were strictly followed.
*   Implementation focused solely on the backend logic for damage, shield, and status effect application.
*   Only the specified scripts and necessary integration points in `CombatManager.cs` were modified.
*   No changes were made to `CharacterData.cs` or other unrelated systems (Networking, UI, Scene Management, etc.).
*   The implemented logic correctly handles runtime state only; no data persistence logic was added for HP, Shield, or Status Effects.
*   No complex calculations, advanced stacking rules beyond the specified "add stacks, reset duration", UI elements, or VFX were implemented.
*   No unnecessary refactoring was performed on existing code.
*   No additional helper classes or systems were created beyond `CharacterCombat` and `CombatActions`.

# Task CS-04: Implement Basic Team Roster Management - Implementation Summary

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Assets/Scripts/Managers/TeamRosterManager.cs**  
   - Implemented the TeamRosterManager component with the following features:
     - Created a data structure (List<CharacterData>) to store the team roster
     - Added a public property for external access to the list
     - Implemented character management functions:
       - AddCharacter(CharacterData) - Adds a character to the roster
       - GetCharacter(int) - Retrieves a character by index
       - GetCharacterByName(string) - Retrieves a character by name
       - GetRosterSize() - Returns the current roster size
       - RemoveCharacter(int) - Removes a character by index
     - Created three default CharacterData objects in Awake() for testing:
       - "Valiant Knight" (Level 3, 100 HP, 50 Energy)
       - "Arcane Mage" (Level 2, 75 HP, 60 Energy)
       - "Swift Ranger" (Level 2, 85 HP, 55 Energy)

## Notes

- The implementation strictly follows the CharacterData structure from CS-03 without modifications
- No separate singleton pattern was implemented; the TeamRosterManager relies on the GameManager's DontDestroyOnLoad for persistence
- The GameManager already had the necessary reference to TeamRosterManager, so no changes were needed there
- Each default character is fully initialized with all required properties according to the CharacterData structure
- The implementation includes only functionality directly related to managing the team roster
- All code is thoroughly commented for clarity and maintainability
- The TeamRosterManager integrates with the existing GameManager singleton pattern as specified in the requirements

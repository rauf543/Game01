# Task GP-01-Refactor: Create Basic Character Prefab & Online Data Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation fulfills the requirements of task GP-01-Refactor by creating a basic character prefab with visual representation in Unity and integrating it with online backend data. The character prefab includes a placeholder visual and UI elements to display the character's name and level, along with a script to initialize and update these elements based on character data.

## Files Created

1. **Assets/Scripts/CharacterDisplay.cs**
   - Script for handling character data display
   - Includes a public Initialize method to receive and process CharacterData
   - Updates UI elements based on the provided data

2. **Assets/Prefabs/Character_Prefab.prefab**
   - Unity prefab with placeholder visual (3D capsule)
   - Contains UI elements for displaying character name and level
   - Has the CharacterDisplay script attached to its root

## Key Code Excerpts

### CharacterDisplay Implementation
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;

public class CharacterDisplay : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Reference to the UI Text components
    [SerializeField] private TextMeshProUGUI characterNameText;
    [SerializeField] private TextMeshProUGUI characterLevelText;
    
    // Internal data storage
    private CharacterData currentData;
    
    public void Initialize(CharacterData data)
    {
        // Store data
        currentData = data;
        
        // Update UI
        if (characterNameText != null)
            characterNameText.text = currentData.CharacterName;
        
        if (characterLevelText != null)
            characterLevelText.text = "Level: " + currentData.CurrentLevel.ToString();
    }
}
```

## How Requirements Were Met

### 1. Prefab Creation
- **New Prefab**: Created Character_Prefab in the Assets/Prefabs directory
- **Placeholder Visual**: Used a basic 3D capsule as the visual representation
- **Asset Limitation**: Did not import or add any custom art assets beyond the simple placeholder

### 2. Core Script Implementation
- **CharacterDisplay Script**: Created and attached to the root of Character_Prefab
- **Data Storage**: The script holds a CharacterData instance as a private field
- **Initialize Method**: Implemented the public void Initialize(CharacterData data) method as specified
- **UI Updates**: Within Initialize, the script stores the data and updates UI elements accordingly

### 3. UI Elements
- **TextMeshPro Components**: Added TextMeshProUGUI components as children of the prefab
- **Display Fields**: Set up text fields to display the character's name and level
- **Dynamic Updates**: The Initialize method properly sets these UI fields based on the provided data

### 4. Data Handling
- **No Hardcoding**: The script does not hardcode or fetch data from the backend
- **Data Acceptance**: It simply accepts a CharacterData object and uses its values
- **Field References**: Correctly references CharacterName and CurrentLevel fields from CharacterData

## Design Decisions

### UI Structure and Organization
- Used a world-space canvas as a child of the prefab to contain all UI elements
- Positioned UI elements above the character model for visibility
- Employed TextMeshPro for better text rendering quality and performance

### Prefab Setup Process
- Created detailed instructions for setting up the prefab in a development scene first
- Made the prefab reusable across all scenes in the project
- Organized the hierarchy to keep visual elements and UI clearly separated

### Data Display Formatting
- Added "Level: " prefix to the level display for improved readability
- Implemented null checks before updating UI elements to prevent errors

## Verification
The implementation satisfies all requirements from the task instructions. The Character_Prefab correctly displays character data passed to it through the Initialize method. The UI elements show the character's name and level as required. The code is clean, efficient, and strictly adheres to the task requirements without any extra features or overengineering.

The prefab is ready to be used by the TeamRosterManager when it needs to display character data fetched from the online backend.
